# WinRar no Ads

## Overview

WinRar is a File Browser App that I cracked to remove the purchase pop-up every time you opened anything. This was also a learning experience in reverse engineering.
This is the type of pop-up that has been removed:

## Installation

1. Download the installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/file-browser-app/releases).
2. Run the installer.
3. The app will be installed in `C:\Program Files`.
